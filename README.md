# seawater_level

In this project you will analyze the changes in the seawater level in some measuring station. The user will enter the measurements (i.e. sea levels)
to the program after which the program will calculate some statistical characteristics and display them to the user.

In the following sections some mathematical definitions are given for the most common characteristic values used in statistics- min,max,mean,median,variance,statndard deviation

# Median
Median is the center element of the set of values which have been ordered in an increasing (or decreasing) order.
# Mean (i.e. Average)
The mean of a set of values is calculated by adding all the values in the data set together and dividing the result by the number of the values
# Variance
When the mean is known we can calculate a characteristic called variance (Ïƒ^2). The variance is a way of describing how the measurements are spread around the mean 
and it is calculated by taking the sum of the squares for each value of the data set subtracted by the mean 
and dividing this result by , where N is (as before) the number of the values in the data set
# Standard Deviation
From a variance we can calculate the standerd deviation (or SD), which is simply the square root of the variance
